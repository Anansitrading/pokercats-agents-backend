## Core Principles

### 1. The Foundation of Great Scripts

**Key Truth:** A video script is a blueprint for visual storytelling, not a document to be read. Every word must be spoken, heard, and felt.

**Core Principles:**
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Use concrete examples over abstractions
- **One Clear Goal**: Every script serves ONE primary objective
- **Audience-First**: Write for your viewer's pain points and desires, not your product features
- **Conversational Tone**: Scripts are meant to be heard, not read silently
- **Visual Thinking**: Every line should have a corresponding visual element

### 2. The Purpose of a Script

A video script serves multiple critical functions:

1. **Clarity of Message**: Forces you to define key objectives and prevent message overload
2. **Time & Budget Savings**: Pre-planning prevents costly production mistakes and reshoots
3. **Consistency**: Ensures coherent messaging across all channels and formats
4. **Team Alignment**: Creates shared vision between writers, directors, animators, and stakeholders
5. **Engagement Target**: Speaks directly to specific buyer personas with relevant messaging

### 3. Scripts vs. Screenplays

**Screenplays** are for narrative films with character arcs, dialogue, and dramatic structure.  
**Video Scripts** are for marketing, explainer, training, and commercial videos with clear messaging and CTAs.

**Key Differences:**
- Scripts are shorter (typically 15s-2min)
- Scripts are goal-oriented (conversions, education, awareness)
- Scripts include two-column format (visual + audio)
- Scripts prioritize clarity over artistic expression
- Scripts end with specific calls-to-action

---

## Script Structure & Format

### Industry-Standard Two-Column Format

The two-column script format is the gold standard for video production. It synchronizes visual and audio elements, ensuring nothing is lost in translation from script to screen.

```
|  VISUAL (Left Column)          |  AUDIO (Right Column)           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Scene description               | Voiceover narration            |
| Camera directions               | Dialogue                        |
| On-screen text                  | Sound effects notes            |
| Graphics/animations             | Music cues                      |
| Timing cues                     | Pronunciation guides           |
```

**Example:**
```
| VISUAL                          | AUDIO                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Open on frustrated marketer     | VO: "Another deadline missed.   |
| at messy desk, surrounded by    | Another budget blown."          |
| papers. Clock shows 11:58pm.    |                                 |
| Shot duration: 5 seconds        | [Pause 1 second]                |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Cut to: Clean, modern office.   | VO: "What if video production   |
| Same person, now confident,     | could be simple, fast, and      |
| reviewing beautiful video on    | affordable?"                    |
| large monitor.                  |                                 |
| Shot duration: 5 seconds        |                                 |
```

### Script Elements

#### 1. Scene Headings
- **Format**: `SCENE #: LOCATION - TIME`
- **Example**: `SCENE 1: MARKETING OFFICE - DAY`
- Keep locations specific but concise
- Include time of day when relevant to mood

#### 2. Visual Descriptions
- Be specific about what's on screen
- Include camera movements when critical
- Note on-screen text exactly as it should appear
- Specify timing for each scene/shot

- Include pronunciation guides for technical terms: `[Analytics: anna-LIT-iks]`
- Mark natural pauses: `[Pause 2 seconds]`
- Note emotional delivery: `[Confident and upbeat]`
- Keep sentences short and conversational

#### 4. Timing Notes
- Mark duration for each scene: `[Duration: 5 seconds]`
- Total script timing should match target video length
- Allow for natural pauses and visual processing time
- Standard pace: 130-150 words per minute

## The Three-Act Structure

### Act 1: The Hook (0-5 seconds)
**Goal:** Stop the scroll. Grab attention immediately.

**Techniques:**
- **Open with the problem**: "Tired of expensive video production?"
- **Ask a rhetorical question**: "What if you could create pro videos in minutes?"
- **State shocking fact**: "73% of B2B buyers watch video before purchasing"
- **Show the end result**: Start with the transformation, then explain how
- **Create curiosity gap**: Tease the value without revealing the solution

**Example Hooks:**
```
❌ Weak: "Welcome to our video about project management software."
✅ Strong: "Another project deadline. Another team meeting. Another migraine."

❌ Weak: "Today I'll show you our new features."
✅ Strong: "What if you could cut your video production time by 80%?"
```

### Act 2: The Problem & Solution (5-45 seconds)

#### Part A: Establish the Problem (5-15s)
- **Elaborate on the pain point** mentioned in the hook
- **Show empathy**: Demonstrate you understand their world
- **Build tension**: Make the problem feel urgent and real
- **Use specific scenarios** your audience experiences daily

**Example:**
```
"Creating videos shouldn't mean sacrificing your sanity—or your budget. 
Traditional agencies charge $10K+ and take months. Freelancers are 
inconsistent. DIY tools require skills you don't have. Meanwhile, your 
competitors are using video to crush it."
```

#### Part B: Introduce the Solution (15-35s)
- **Present your product/service** as the logical answer
- **Focus on benefits**, not features
- **Show how it works** with clear, simple steps
- **Demonstrate ease of use**: Make it seem effortless

**Example:**
```
"Meet [Product]. Turn your ideas into professional videos in three simple steps:
1. Describe your vision to our AI
2. Review multiple creative options from vetted creators
3. Select your favorite and launch

No agencies. No delays. No guesswork."
```

#### Part C: Proof & Benefits (35-50s)
- **Social proof**: Testimonials, logos, stats
- **Key differentiators**: What makes you unique
- **Results**: Specific, measurable outcomes
- **Visual demonstrations**: Show the product in action

### Act 3: The Call-to-Action (50-60 seconds)

**Goal:** Give viewers ONE clear, specific next step.

**CTA Framework:**
1. **Transition phrase**: "Ready to transform your video production?"
2. **Specific action**: "Start your free trial today"
3. **Value reinforcement**: "No credit card required. Cancel anytime."
4. **Visual cue**: Logo, URL, button, QR code

**Strong CTAs:**
- ✅ "Start your free trial at [URL]"
- ✅ "Book a 15-minute demo today"
- ✅ "Download the free guide"
- ✅ "Join 10,000+ marketers using [Product]"

**Weak CTAs:**
- ❌ "Learn more"
- ❌ "Visit our website"
- ❌ "Contact us for more information"

## The 8-Part Story Structure

### Advanced Three-Act Breakdown

While the three-act structure provides the foundation, professional video storytelling often employs a more detailed 8-part framework that maps specific story beats to create psychological resonance and transformation.

**The 8 Story Beats:**

```
Act 1 (25%)          Act 2 (50%)                    Act 3 (25%)
│                    │                              │
Hook ─ Inciting ─ 1st Plot ─ 1st Pinch ─ Midpoint ─ 2nd Pinch ─ 3rd Plot ─ Climax
       Event        Point       Point                Point        Point
│                    │                              │
0%    12%           25%    37%       50%      62%       75%       90%
```

### Beat 1: The Hook (0-5% of runtime)

**Purpose:** Answer the fundamental question: "Why should they keep watching?"

**Key Principles:**
- Create immediate engagement through curiosity or recognition
- Open *in medias res* (in the midst of things) when appropriate
- Establish a question that viewers want answered
- Serve as a "first domino" that leads to the main conflict

**For Video Marketing:**
```
"Another deadline missed..." [Creates tension]
"What if I told you there's a better way?" [Creates curiosity]
"This changed everything for us..." [Creates interest]
```

### Beat 2: Inciting Event (12% of runtime)

**Purpose:** The moment protagonists first encounter the main conflict

**Key Characteristics:**
- Characters "brush up against" the problem
- They are given a choice to engage or not
- Not yet full immersion—just the initial contact
- Sets narrative in motion
- Stakes must be established beforehand for impact

**For Video Marketing:**
```
Problem Introduction: "Sarah spent $10K on video agencies..."
Choice Presented: "Then she discovered [Product]..."
Stakes: "Her budget was gone. Her deadline was tomorrow."
```

### Beat 3: First Plot Point (25% - End of Act 1)

**Purpose:** The point of no return that thrusts the story into Act 2

**Defining Features:**
- Full immersion into the conflict begins
- Characters fully committed to their goal
- Something changes dramatically—world, self, or perspective
- Even if they wanted to retreat, they can't return to who they were
- Typically the most memorable transition in the story

**For Video Marketing:**
```
"When Sarah launched her first campaign with [Product]..." [Commitment]
"She knew there was no going back to the old way." [Transformation]
"The results spoke for themselves..." [New reality]
```

### Beat 4: First Pinch Point (37% of runtime)

**Purpose:** Emphasize the antagonistic force and what's at stake

**Function:**
- Show what characters stand to lose
- Introduce obstacles in Act 2
- Can be subtle or dramatic turning points
- Often sets up the midpoint
- Checks in with the opposing force

**For Video Marketing:**
```
Challenge: "But then her competitor launched their campaign..."
Stakes: "She had 48 hours to respond..."
Obstacle: "With half the budget and no creative team..."
```

### Beat 5: Midpoint / Moment of Truth (50% - Second Plot Point)

**Purpose:** Major turning point that changes perspective and direction

**Critical Characteristics:**
- Everything changes at this moment
- Character's understanding of the conflict transforms
- Shift from reactive to proactive mode
- The story pivots in a new direction toward climax
- Often the most iconic moment viewers remember
- Stakes are raised significantly

**For Video Marketing:**
```
Discovery: "Then Sarah discovered the AI feature..."
Transformation: "Her entire approach changed..."
New Direction: "Instead of fighting alone, she had a system..."
Results: "In 24 hours, she created what used to take weeks..."
```

### Beat 6: Second Pinch Point (62% of runtime)

**Purpose:** Emphasize antagonistic force again and set up the final act

**Function:**
- Stakes higher than ever before
- Shows what characters really stand to lose
- Sets up the third plot point (false victory/low moment)
- Demonstrates consequences of continuing
- Amplifies tension before final act

**For Video Marketing:**
```
Rising Stakes: "Her competitors noticed..."
Consequence: "They doubled down on their spending..."
Pressure: "Sarah's boss demanded immediate results..."
Risk: "Everything was on the line..."
```

### Beat 7: Third Plot Point (75% - Beginning of Act 3)

**Purpose:** The "false victory" followed by the "low moment" or "dark night of the soul"

**Dual Nature:**
- Character throws all resources at the goal
- Achieves some victory, but cost is higher than expected
- The win isn't the final push needed
- Psychological resonance of transformation deepens
- Can be the character's darkest hour

**For Video Marketing:**
```
False Victory: "Sarah's campaign launched successfully..."
Hidden Cost: "...but the results weren't immediate..."
Low Moment: "For 48 hours, nothing happened..."
Doubt: "Had she made the wrong choice?"
```

### Beat 8: Climax (Final 10% of runtime)

**Purpose:** The ultimate confrontation that decides the conflict

**Essential Elements:**
- Final turning point into climax proper
- Personal confrontation with the central challenge
- Deciding moment of the entire story
- Fulfills the character's arc
- Determines whether goal is achieved or lost
- Should feel earned and inevitable

**For Video Marketing:**
```
Resolution: "Then the data started coming in..."
Victory: "10x engagement. 5x conversions. Half the cost."
Transformation: "Sarah became the team's video leader..."
New Reality: "She never went back to the old way..."
```

### Applying the 8-Part Structure to Video Scripts

**For 60-Second Videos:**
- Hook: 0-3s (5%)
- Inciting Event: 3-7s (12%)
- 1st Plot Point: 12-15s (25%)
- 1st Pinch Point: 20-22s (37%)
- Midpoint: 28-30s (50%)
- 2nd Pinch Point: 35-37s (62%)
- 3rd Plot Point: 43-45s (75%)
- Climax: 52-60s (90-100%)

**Key Insight:** Not every beat needs equal screen time. Some can be implied or combined, but the psychological progression should remain intact.

### Character Arc Integration

**The structure isn't just about plot—it's about transformation:**

```
Hook → Character in "normal" state
Inciting Event → First glimpse of needed change
1st Plot Point → Commitment to change begins
1st Pinch Point → Obstacles to change appear
Midpoint → "Moment of truth" - perspective shifts
2nd Pinch Point → Cost of change becomes clear
3rd Plot Point → Darkest moment before breakthrough
Climax → Transformation complete, new state achieved
```

**For Marketing Videos:**
Replace "character transformation" with "customer transformation" or "problem to solution journey."

### Structure as a Gift Box Analogy

Think of story structure as a gift box:
- The **box shape** is always the same (the 8 beats)
- The **wrapping and bow** vary (your style and tone)
- The **contents** are infinite (your unique message)

This framework provides consistency while allowing creativity to flourish within it.

## Emotional Arc & Pacing

### The Emotional Journey

Great scripts take viewers on an emotional journey. The arc should mirror the problem-solution narrative:

```
Tension/Frustration → Curiosity/Interest → Hope/Possibility → Confidence/Resolution
```

**Scene-by-Scene Emotional Mapping:**

| Scene | Timing | Emotion Target | Technique |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Hook | 0-5s | Tension/Recognition | Show relatable pain point |
| Problem | 5-20s | Empathy/Understanding | Elaborate on frustration |
| Solution | 20-45s | Hope/Excitement | Present the answer |
| Benefits | 45-55s | Confidence/Desire | Prove it works |
| CTA | 55-60s | Urgency/Action | Make next step clear |

### Pacing Techniques

#### 1. Sentence Length Variation
- **Short sentences** create energy and urgency
- **Longer sentences** provide detail and explanation
- **Vary rhythm** to maintain interest

**Example:**
```
"Stop. Listen. Your competition is winning. [Short, punchy]

They're using video to educate prospects, nurture leads, and close 
deals while you're stuck creating PowerPoints. [Medium, explanatory]

But here's the thing: you don't need a Hollywood budget or a film 
degree to create videos that convert. [Long, transitional]

You just need the right tool."[Short, conclusive]
```

#### 2. Natural Pauses
- Allow time for visual elements to register
- Create emphasis on key points
- Give viewers processing time
- Standard pause: 1-2 seconds

**Marking Pauses:**
```
"Introducing [Product Name]. [PAUSE 2 seconds]
The fastest way to create professional videos. [PAUSE 1 second]
Without the agency price tag."
```

#### 3. Rhythm and Flow
- Use transitional phrases: "Here's how," "Watch this," "But wait"
- Create momentum with "and," "plus," "also"
- Build anticipation with "imagine," "picture this," "what if"

---

## Visual Storytelling

### Show, Don't Tell Principles

**Golden Rule:** If you can show it, don't say it. Let visuals do the heavy lifting.

**Examples:**

❌ **Telling:**
```
AUDIO: "Our software has an intuitive dashboard that makes 
data analysis easy."
```

✅ **Showing:**
```
VISUAL: Screen recording of user clicking through dashboard, 
insights appearing instantly
AUDIO: "See your insights. Instantly."
```

### Visual-Audio Synchronization

**Critical Timing Points:**
- **Introduce visual 0.5s before mentioning it** in voiceover
- **Keep visual on screen for 2-3s** after mentioned
- **Transition visuals during natural pauses** in narration
- **Match emotional tone** of visuals to audio

**Example:**
```
| VISUAL                          | AUDIO                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| [0.5s] Product interface        |                                 |
| appears on screen               |                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| [1.0s] Interface visible        | VO: "Our dashboard shows..."    |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| [3.0s] Highlight specific       | VO: "...real-time analytics"    |
| feature                         |                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| [3.5s] Feature demonstration    | VO: "updated every second."     |
| plays                           |                                 |
```

### On-Screen Text Guidelines

**When to Use:**
- Reinforce key statistics or numbers
- Highlight product names or features
- Display CTAs and URLs
- Translate or supplement voiceover

**Best Practices:**
- **Maximum 2 lines** per screen
- **6-9 words per line** (optimal readability)
- **3-second minimum** on-screen time
- **Large, readable font** (minimum 36pt)
- **High contrast** against background
- **Consistent placement** throughout video

**Example:**
```
VISUAL: Animated text appears
"10,000+ Happy Customers"
[Stays on screen 4 seconds]

AUDIO: VO: "Join ten thousand happy customers who've 
transformed their video marketing."
```

---

## Dialogue & Voiceover

### Writing for the Ear, Not the Eye

**Key Principle:** Scripts are heard, not read. Write as people actually speak.

**Conversational Techniques:**

1. **Use Contractions**
   - ❌ "We are the leading platform"
   - ✅ "We're the leading platform"

2. **Short, Active Sentences**
   - ❌ "The platform was designed by our team to be utilized by marketers"
   - ✅ "We built this platform for marketers like you"

3. **Direct Address**
   - ❌ "Users will find that the software is intuitive"
   - ✅ "You'll find it incredibly intuitive"

4. **Question-Answer Flow**
   ```
   "Need to create videos fast? [Pause]
   We've got you covered.
   
   Worried about quality? [Pause]
   Our vetted creators ensure every frame is perfect."
   ```

### Tone & Voice Matching

Your script's tone must match your brand personality and audience expectations.

**Tone Examples by Video Type:**

| Video Type | Tone | Example Language |
|------------|------|------------------|
| B2B SaaS | Professional, confident | "Streamline workflows. Drive ROI." |
| Consumer Product | Friendly, enthusiastic | "You're gonna love this!" |
| Healthcare | Caring, authoritative | "Your health matters. Here's how we help." |
| Education | Clear, supportive | "Let's break this down together." |
| Startup | Bold, disruptive | "Forget everything you know about [X]." |

### Voiceover Best Practices

1. **Pace**: 130-150 words per minute (sweet spot: 140 WPM)
2. **Pronunciation Guides**: Mark all technical terms, names, acronyms
   ```
   AUDIO: "Try Kajabi [kuh-JAH-bee] today"
   ```
3. **Emphasis Marks**: Bold or underline words that need vocal stress
   ```
   AUDIO: "You get THREE videos. Not one. **Three**."
   ```
4. **Delivery Notes**: Include emotional direction
   ```
   AUDIO: [Excited, energetic] "This changes everything!"
   AUDIO: [Calm, reassuring] "We're here to help."
   ```

---

## Hook & CTA Techniques

### The Psychology of Hooks

**First 3 Seconds Rule:** 65% of viewers who watch past 3 seconds will watch to 10 seconds. Hook them hard.

**Proven Hook Formulas:**

#### 1. The Problem Hook
```
"Struggling with [specific pain point]?"
"Tired of [common frustration]?"
"Hate it when [relatable scenario]?"
```

#### 2. The Benefit Hook
```
"What if you could [desired outcome] in [short timeframe]?"
"Imagine [ideal scenario]..."
"[Specific result] in just [time/steps]."
```

#### 3. The Curiosity Hook
```
"Here's a secret most [audience] don't know..."
"The one thing that changed everything..."
"Why [unexpected statement]."
```

#### 4. The Social Proof Hook
```
"Join [number] [audience] who are already [benefit]..."
"[Impressive stat] of users report [outcome]..."
"Used by [recognizable brands/people]..."
```

#### 5. The Bold Statement Hook
```
"Everything you know about [topic] is wrong."
"[Topic] is dead. Here's what replaced it."
"Stop [common action]. Start [alternative]."
```

### Call-to-Action Mastery

**CTA Formula:**
```
[Transition] + [Specific Action] + [Value Proposition] + [Urgency/Risk Reversal]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **E-commerce:**
```
"Ready to upgrade your style? 
Shop the collection now. 
Free shipping on orders over $50. 
Limited time only."
```

✅ **SaaS:**
```
"See it in action. 
Book your free demo today. 
No credit card required. 
Join 5,000+ teams who've made the switch."
```

✅ **Lead Generation:**
```
"Want the full playbook? 
Download our free guide. 
Get instant access. 
Just enter your email below."
```

**CTA Placement:**
- **Primary CTA**: Last 10 seconds of video
- **Secondary CTA**: On-screen throughout (subscribe, follow, etc.)
- **Visual CTA**: End card with logo, URL, button

---

## Timing & Word Count

### The Golden Ratio: Words Per Minute

**Standard Speaking Pace:**
- **Slow/Clear**: 110-120 WPM (educational, elderly audience)
- **Optimal**: 130-150 WPM (most professional videos)
- **Fast/Energetic**: 150-170 WPM (social media, youth audience)
- **Too Fast**: 170+ WPM (risks comprehension)

### Video Length Guidelines

| Video Length | Word Count | Best For |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 15 seconds | 30-40 words | Social ads, teasers |
| 30 seconds | 60-75 words | Commercial spots, quick promos |
| 45 seconds | 90-110 words | Product demos, features |
| 60 seconds | 130-150 words | Explainers, testimonials |
| 90 seconds | 195-225 words | Deep dives, tutorials |
| 2 minutes | 260-300 words | Full explainers, case studies |

### Calculating Exact Timing

**Formula:**
```
Video Length (seconds) = (Word Count ÷ Words Per Minute) × 60
```

**Example:**
```
Script: 140 words
Pace: 140 WPM
Calculation: (140 ÷ 140) × 60 = 60 seconds
```

**Pro Tip:** Always add 10-15% buffer time for:
- Natural pauses
- Visual processing moments
- On-screen text reading time
- Intro/outro animations

## Advanced Formatting Rules

### Historical Context: Script Format Evolution

Understanding the evolution of script formats helps explain why modern standards exist:

**Timeline of Script Development:**

1. **Scenarios (1890s-1900s)** - Few sentences summarizing short films
2. **Master Scene Format (1903)** - Series of scene descriptions without shot details
3. **Continuity Script (1920s)** - Detailed shot-by-shot specifications for studio system efficiency
4. **Modern Master Scene Script (1948-present)** - Balance of readability and functionality

**Why Modern Format Matters:**
- The **package-unit system** (post-1948) shifted focus from production efficiency to **sellability**
- Scripts became less technically specific, giving directors more creative control
- Emphasis on **storytelling and readability** over shot-by-shot instructions
- This is the format used today for video scripts

### Screenplay Element Capitalization Rules

**Elements That MUST Be Capitalized:**

#### 1. Character Names (First Appearance Only)
```
VISUAL: A young woman enters. This is SARAH (28), 
a marketing manager with determination in her eyes.
```
**Rule:** Only capitalize the FIRST TIME a character appears in action description.

#### 2. Sound Effects
```
VISUAL: The door SLAMS shut. 
AUDIO: BOOM! Thunder crashes outside.
```
**Rule:** Capitalize significant sound effects to emphasize them.

#### 3. Important Props (When Critical)
```
VISUAL: She holds the GOLDEN TICKET in trembling hands.
```
**Rule:** Only capitalize props that are crucial to the plot. Don't overdo it.

#### 4. Camera Emphasis (Sparingly)
```
VISUAL: CLOSE ON: Her face as realization hits.
```
**Rule:** Use rarely in video scripts. Let the description imply the shot.

**What NOT to Capitalize:**
- ❌ Every noun
- ❌ Character names after first appearance
- ❌ Regular props
- ❌ Common actions
- ❌ Descriptive words for emphasis

### Scene Headings (Slug Lines) - Advanced

**Basic Format:**
```
INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME
```

**Interior Locations:**
```
INT. MARKETING OFFICE - DAY
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
```

**Exterior Locations:**
```
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
EXT. PARK BENCH - SUNSET
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN
```

**Combined Locations:**
```
INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY
INT./EXT. DOORWAY - NIGHT
```

**Multiple Locations in Same Scene:**
```
INT. OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
EXT. BUILDING - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
```

**Time Specifications:**
- **Clock time**: DAY, NIGHT, DAWN, DUSK, MORNING, AFTERNOON
- **Relative time**: CONTINUOUS, MOMENTS LATER, LATER, SAME TIME
- **Special**: FLASHBACK, DREAM SEQUENCE

### Subheadings for Location Shifts

**When to Use:**
When changing location without breaking the scene (maintaining time continuity).

**Format:**
```
INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah paces nervously, phone in hand.

BEDROOM

She enters, still on the phone.

KITCHEN

She makes coffee while talking.
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Scene Heading**: Breaks the scene, includes INT/EXT and time
- **Subheading**: Uppercase location only, no INT/EXT, keeps scene flowing

### Action Line Best Practices

**Write in Present Tense:**
```
✅ Sarah ENTERS the room. She SPOTS the envelope.
❌ Sarah entered the room. She spotted the envelope.
```

**Avoid Internal Thoughts:**
```
❌ Sarah thinks about her deadline.
✅ Sarah glances at the clock, worry crossing her face.
```

**Keep It Visual:**
```
❌ Sarah feels anxious about the presentation.
✅ Sarah's hands tremble as she arranges her notes.
```

**Paragraph Length:**
- Maximum 4 lines per paragraph
- Break at logical action beats
- White space improves readability
- One action/idea per paragraph when possible

### Parenthetical Usage

**Purpose:** Brief character direction for delivery

**Format:**
```
SARAH
(frustrated)
I've tried everything!

JOHN
(sarcastically)
Everything?

SARAH
(defensively)
Well, almost everything.
```

**Keep Them Short:**
- ✅ (quietly), (angry), (to herself), (laughing)
- ❌ (trying to hide her frustration while maintaining professionalism)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Don't use for camera directions
- Don't use for who the character is speaking to (use action line instead)
- Don't overuse - let dialogue speak for itself

### Transition Usage (Minimal)

**Modern Standard:** Use transitions sparingly. Most are implied.

**When to Include:**
- **FADE IN:** - Traditional opening (optional in modern scripts)
- **FADE OUT:** - Final line of script
- **CUT TO:** - When timing matters (rarely needed)
- **DISSOLVE TO:** - For time passage (mostly obsolete)

**Modern Approach:**
Let scene breaks imply cuts. Only use transitions when absolutely necessary for clarity.

### Monospaced Font Importance

**Why 12pt Courier?**

1. **Timing Consistency**
   - Every character takes same horizontal space
   - 1 page ≈ 1 minute of screen time (screenplay standard)
   - Predictable page count

2. **Universal Compatibility**
   - Works on typewriters and computers
   - Set as industry standard in 1980s
   - Ensures consistent formatting across systems

3. **Readability**
   - Monospaced fonts are easier to skim
   - Clear character/word count
   - Professional appearance

**For Video Scripts:**
While you may use other fonts, maintain the spacing principle: make timing predictable.

### Page Formatting Specifications

**Margins (Screenplay Standard):**
- Left: 1.5 inches (for binding)
- Right: 1 inch
- Top: 1 inch
- Bottom: 1 inch

**Element Positions:**
- **Scene Headings**: 1.5" from left
- **Action**: 1.5" from left, extends to 1" from right
- **Character Name**: 3.7" from left (centered-ish)
- **Dialogue**: 2.5" from left, extends to 2.5" from right
- **Parentheticals**: 3.1" from left
- **Transitions**: Right-aligned, 1" from right

**Page Numbers:**
- Top right corner
- Start on page 2 (page 1 has no number)

### Title Page Standards

**Required Elements:**
```
                    TITLE
                (All Caps, Centered)

                      by

                Your Name


                                           Draft Date
                                           December 2025

```

**"Based on" Credit:**
```
                    TITLE

                      by

                Your Name

          Based on "Original Work"
             by Original Author
```

### White Space Principles

**Why White Space Matters:**
- Improved readability
- Easier for production team to make notes
- Prevents overwhelming dense blocks of text
- Signals pacing to the reader

**Best Practices:**
- Break action paragraphs every 3-4 lines
- Single space between scene elements
- Double space before new scene headings
- Use sparse dialogue for fast pacing
- Use dense dialogue for heavy scenes

### Script Length Estimation

**Screenplay Standard:**
- 1 page = ~1 minute of screen time
- Feature film: 90-120 pages
- TV episode: 22-44 pages (depending on format)

**Video Script Adaptation:**
- 1 page (in screenplay format) ≈ 130-150 words
- 60-second video = ~140 words = ~1 page
- Scale accordingly for your target length

### Common Formatting Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Over-directing**
```
CLOSE UP on Sarah's face as she SLOWLY turns to camera.
CUT TO: Wide shot of the room.
```

✅ **Implied camera work**
```
Sarah's eyes widen. She slowly turns.

The entire room is empty.
```

❌ **Writing what we can't see**
```
Sarah thinks about quitting. She remembers her first day.
```

✅ **Writing the visible**
```
Sarah stares at her resignation letter, fingers hovering over the keyboard.
A photo of her first day catches her eye.
```

❌ **Dialogue without action**
```
JOHN
Let's go.

SARAH
Where?

JOHN
You'll see.
```

✅ **Dialogue with visual context**
```
John grabs his coat.

JOHN
Let's go.

Sarah doesn't move.

SARAH
Where?

John smiles mysteriously.

JOHN
You'll see.
```

### Formatting for Different Video Types

**For Marketing Videos:**
- Less strict than screenplays
- Focus on two-column format
- Include specific timing notes
- More on-screen text annotations

**For Training Videos:**
- More detailed action descriptions
- Include learning objective notes
- May need multiple language columns
- Accessibility annotations important

**For Documentary Scripts:**
- Include interview subject names
- Note B-roll suggestions in visuals
- Mark natural sound moments
- Flexible structure with reality contingencies

### Modern Software vs. Manual Formatting

**Professional Software Advantages:**
- Auto-formats as you type
- Hotkeys for element switching
- Correct margins automatically
- Page count tracking
- Collaboration features

**For Video Scripts:**
- StudioBinder, Celtx, Final Draft for screenplay format
- Google Docs templates for simpler two-column
- Even simple tables work for basic video scripts

**Key Point:** The format rules exist to ensure clarity. Whether using software or manual formatting, the goal is readability and production-readiness.

## ScriptSmith Agent Integration Notes

### How This Guide Informs the Agent

**VRD → Script Translation:**
The ScriptSmith agent uses this guide to transform VRD specifications into production-ready scripts:

1. **Extract from VRD:**
   - Target audience (demographics, pain points) → informs tone and hook
   - Key messages (core + supporting) → become script body
   - Content structure (timing) → dictates scene breakdown
   - Style/mood → influences language and pacing

2. **Apply Frameworks:**
   - Use three-act structure as foundation
   - Apply 8-part story beats for psychological resonance
   - Match video type (explainer, demo, ad) to appropriate template
   - Follow timing/word count guidelines exactly
   - Ensure each beat serves its narrative purpose

3. **Generate Output:**
   - Two-column format with visual + audio
   - Scene-by-scene breakdown with timing
   - Specific voiceover scripts
   - On-screen text notes
   - Pronunciation guides

### Quality Standards

Every ScriptSmith output must:
- ✅ Honor VRD timing constraints (±5s tolerance)
- ✅ Address audience pain points explicitly
- ✅ Include all key messages from VRD
- ✅ Match tone specification
- ✅ End with clear, actionable CTA
- ✅ Use two-column format
- ✅ Include scene timing notes

## Quick Reference Summary

### The Complete ScriptSmith Workflow

**Phase 1: Analyze VRD Input**
1. Extract target audience and pain points
2. Identify key messages (core + 3-5 supporting)
3. Note duration and timing breakdown
4. Understand tone and emotional journey

**Phase 2: Choose Structure**
- **Simple videos (15-30s)**: Basic 3-act (Hook → Solution → CTA)
- **Standard videos (45-90s)**: Full 3-act with problem-solution-proof
- **Complex videos (90s+)**: 8-part structure for deep psychological resonance

**Phase 3: Apply Story Beats**
```
Hook (5%) → Inciting Event (12%) → 1st Plot Point (25%) → 
1st Pinch Point (37%) → Midpoint (50%) → 2nd Pinch Point (62%) → 
3rd Plot Point (75%) → Climax (90-100%)
```

**Phase 4: Write in Two-Column Format**
- Left column: Visual descriptions with timing
- Right column: Voiceover/audio with pronunciation guides
- Include on-screen text specifications
- Mark emotional beats

**Phase 5: Verify Quality**
- ✅ Timing matches VRD (±5s tolerance)
- ✅ All pain points addressed
- ✅ All key messages included
- ✅ Tone matches specification
- ✅ CTA is clear and actionable
- ✅ 130-150 words per minute pacing
- ✅ Show-don't-tell principle applied

### The Five Golden Rules

1. **Every word must be heard** - Write for the ear, not the eye
2. **Every scene must show** - Avoid internal thoughts and abstractions
3. **Every beat must build** - Each moment leads to the next
4. **Every message must land** - One clear takeaway per scene
5. **Every script must sell** - Drive toward the call-to-action

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Writing what you can't see (thoughts, feelings without visual expression)
- ❌ Over-explaining (trust your audience's intelligence)
- ❌ Weak hooks (first 3 seconds must grab attention)
- ❌ Vague CTAs ("learn more" instead of specific action)
- ❌ Ignoring timing (one page ≠ one minute if pacing is wrong)
- ❌ Feature dumping (focus on benefits, not specifications)
- ❌ Passive voice (write in active present tense)
- ❌ Inconsistent tone (maintain emotional arc throughout)

### The ScriptSmith Promise

Every script generated must be:
- **Production-Ready**: No ambiguity in execution
- **Audience-Focused**: Speaks to viewer pain points
- **Structurally Sound**: Follows proven narrative frameworks
- **Emotionally Resonant**: Takes viewers on a journey
- **Action-Driving**: Ends with clear next step
- **Professionally Formatted**: Two-column with all specifications
